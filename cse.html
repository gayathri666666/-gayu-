 <marquee>  <br>  Computer science and engineering (CSE) is an academic program at some universities that integrates thefields of computer engineering and computer science</br> <br> Computer engineering is a sub-field of electronics engineering, covering only the digital aspects of electronics engineering,</marquee> specializing in hardware-systems areas like computer architecture, processor design, high-performance computing, parallel processing, computer networks and embedded systems. CSE programs also include core subjects of computer science such as operating systems, theory of computation, design and analysis of algorithms, data structures and database systems.</br> The program aims at designing, developing and troubleshooting computing devices (such as personal computers, supercomputers, robots, smartphones, networking devices, embedded devices), focusing the underlying fundamental issues (like processor architecture design, operating system design, memory management, digital system design, communication protocol design, software development and database management) in the most efficient and effective way.

   Computer science programs typically centers primarily around theory and software, with only some hardware[1]; upper division courses tend to allow a lot of freedom to specialize in software and theory related areas (e.g. algorithms, artificial intelligence, cryptography/security, graphics/visualization, numerical and symbolic computing, operating systems/distributed processing, software engineering).
